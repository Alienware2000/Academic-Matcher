Applications that drive this work are architectural design, cultural heritage documentation and analysis, the study of biological forms, as well as traditional targets such as feature films, games, and other visual media. Computer graphics is one of the disciplines withinYale C2(Creative Consilience of Computing and the Arts). Computer graphics is used extensively in a wide range of domainsâfrom feature film and games to medical visualization and financial analysis. However impressive the growth of computer graphics applications has been over the past 40 years, the goal of easily authoring computer graphics models input remains elusive. At Yale, the research in modeling includes sketching systems for early conceptual design and the capture and editing of digital models of existing physical objects at a range of scalesâfrom entire buildings to individual objects. Computer graphics models need to include material appearance properties as well as geometry. Unfortunately, the models widely used in computer graphics assume that the materials are both pristine and immutable, even though real materials are neither. The goal of research on material and texture models at Yale is to devise new material representations and expressive interfaces for editing such representations, to develop novel methods to simulate materials and the processes that affect their appearance, and to physically measure the input required for material models. Realistic, expressive motion remains an ongoing challenge in computer graphics. In order to generate animations that are both visually convincing and narratively compelling, the animation research at Yale examines new methods for computing the physics that underlie natural phenomena such as rising smoke, splashing water, and the forces that form the characteristic shapes of skin and muscle under human movement. While realism is important, expressivity and artistic directability play an equally key role, and distilling the exact parameters that capture an effective performance remains an open area of research.",

We evaluate their performance in instruction-following tasks and critical fields such as science, finance, law, and healthcare, where accuracy and nuanced understanding are essential. By assessing their ability to generate factual summaries, facilitate professional decision-making, and enhance knowledge accessibility, we aim to ensure LLMs meet the demands of domain-specific applications. Example applications include generating factual summaries under specific domains for specific user needs and queries, curating professional analyses to facilitate decision-making, and enabling knowledge access with high accuracy and efficiency, etc. Additionally, we work on post-training and adaptation techniques to enhance LLM instruction-following capabilities, improving preference optimization algorithms and using LLMs for self-evaluation and supervision. We also focus on adapting LLMs to unfamiliar or out-of-domain tasks, leveraging efficient training and limited in-domain corpora to extend their real-world utility. Our efforts include developing continual pre-training methods, large-scale data synthesis, and domain-specific post-training to improve adaptability. Beyond evaluation and adaptation, we explore mechanistic interpretability techniques to better understand how LLMs process information and make decisions. We investigate their potential to perform logical reasoning and solve mathematical problems, enhancing their ability to handle structured problem-solving. This includes building new benchmarks, designing evaluation paradigms, and training process-reward models to improve LLMs' logical reasoning. We also develop strategies for multi-document reasoning, improving retrieval systems and synthesis capabilities, as seen in MDCure, which enhances multi-document instruction tuning, and DocMath-Eval, which evaluates LLM performance in financial math reasoning. Our research extends to scientific applications, where we create specialized language models, embedding techniques, and benchmarks to enhance LLM understanding of technical knowledge. Projects such as SciRIFF support instruction-following for scientific literature, improving tasks like table extraction, cross-document summarization, and context-grounded reasoning. Through these initiatives, we aim to make LLMs more transparent, adaptable, and effective across diverse domains.",

    "description": "Yale's research in Programming Languages and Verification is focused on creating expressive, efficient, flexible, secure, and reliable programming environments for future information, computation, and communication systems. The department approaches this challenge from multiple angles, including language design, formal methods, compiler implementation, programming environments, and run-time systems. A primary objective of this research is to enable the construction of secure, error-free programs and to develop frameworks that facilitate this goal for other developers. One key area of research involves the development of certified system software, such as OS kernels and hypervisors. Researchers are exploring new language-based technologies to create software that comes with rigorous, machine-checkable proofs of its correctness with respect to specific requirements. This work extends to investigating optimal OS kernel structures for resilience, extensibility, and security, as well as developing new programming languages and environments suitable for implementing such low-level certified programs. The department is also advancing formal methods to support these new languages and make certified programming both practical and scalable. Another significant focus is on software synthesis and verification, aimed at detecting and preventing software errors that cost the global economy trillions annually. This includes projects on automatically learning specifications for complex, unstructured languages, synthesizing Functional Reactive Programming programs from logical specifications, and developing modular verification engines for functional programming languages. Additionally, researchers are exploring privacy-preserving formal methods, heterogeneous computing systems, and the broader field of software ensemble research. This latter area encompasses the study of programs built out of many separate, coordinated activities, including parallel and distributed programs, and draws connections between software ensembles and naturally occurring systems in economics, biology, and physics.",

    "description": "Todayâs society comprises humans living in a complex and interconnected world that is intertwined with a variety of computing, sensing, and communicating devices. Human-generated data is being recorded at unprecedented rates and scales. Knowledge from such data can no longer be derived through simple manual algorithms and require sophisticated AI algorithms. Such powerful algorithms, which are capable of learning from large-scale human-generated data, are increasingly controlling various aspects of modern society, including social interactions (social media and search platforms, newsfeeds), economics (sharing platforms, blockchains, banking), learning, and governance (judgements, policing, voting). While these algorithms have a tremendous potential to change our lives for the better, but, via the ability to mimic and nudge human behavior, they also have the potential to be discriminatory, reinforce societal prejudices, violate privacy, polarize opinions, and influence political processes. As a consequence, the trust in such systemsâfrom a societal, and legal standpointâis plummeting. Further, the lack of an understanding of how humans generate data and how these algorithms extract knowledge from it, or how they influence human behavior, has become a major bottleneck in designing mechanisms to regulate modern society. A key area of study is the development of context-aware decision-making methods. This work aims to mitigate explicit and implicit biases, control polarization, improve diversity, and ensure privacy in algorithmic systems. Researchers are exploring the foundations of these issues and designing new approaches that can enhance the trustworthiness and fairness of computational systems that impact society. The work in this field is inherently interdisciplinary, bridging computer science with political science, law, sociology, economics, psychology and beyond. By studying how humans generate data, how algorithms extract knowledge from it, and how these systems influence human behavior, Yale researchers are contributing to the critical task of designing mechanisms to regulate and improve the integration of advanced computational systems in modern society.",
